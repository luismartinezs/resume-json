Users can toggle between metric and imperial units, list and image view of clothing, and light and dark themes. Selections are locally stored for guest users, while signed-in users have persistent data stored in Firebase. Premium users enjoy AI-powered packing recommendations from OpenAI. The application was developed with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Zustand and combines weather forecasts with clothing advice. OpenWeather API powers the real-time data, and the UI is crafted with Chakra UI. Firebase Firestore handles real-time database updates, while Stripe facilitates payments for premium services. Multi-language support and error tracking with Sentry are other key features.",
