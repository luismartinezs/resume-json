I delivered features such as advanced web search filters and dynamic campaign pages, boosting user experience.

I worked on these tickets in a separate branch and made sure to submit pull requests that were easy to understand and review. Once the important tickets were completed, I conducted a full accessibility audit of the app to identify additional issues. I grouped these issues into new tickets and prioritized them based on their importance. Then I worked on the most important tickets to fix them. As a result, the app became fully accessible, and a second accessibility audit resulted in essentially zero issues reported. My contributions to this project helped ensure that the app was usable and accessible to a broader audience.",
